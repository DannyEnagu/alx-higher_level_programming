# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
	Test-driven development (TDD): simply means writing tests that checks if a program/software satisfies the specified requirements or not. It involve writing test for every possible senario that can cause a program/software/system to fail.

Procedure followed to write tests:

	* Write test that'll fail
	* Then write the program code
	* Then test your program with the failing test to see if it will actually fail
	* Then write correct tests
	* Then test your code
	* Then write more codes
	* Then write more tests

Note: You should start by writing tests that fails, And then write the code that fix or correct the failed test.
